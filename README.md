# BrainFex

BrainFex is designed for brain feature extraction from raw MRI images and built to support my preferred workflow. It is a collection of wrapper scripts that combine commands from core neuroimaging software packages (e.g., FreeSurfer). Through developing it, I aim to gain a better mastery of these software packages and a deeper understanding of their underlying principles. Any advice or contributions would be appreciated.
